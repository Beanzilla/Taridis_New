# Taridis_New
<p> Adds a functioning Tardis to the game minetest </p>
	
<h3>Features:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Gallifreyan Lab: Used to create arton crytals (from mese) and compressed space time (from diamond blocks).  It does not require fuel, but is notably bad for your health!</li>
<li>Tardises: Simply craft a tardis, place it on the ground, and walk through the door.  You'll have to craft seperate console units to control and fly your tardis. </li>
<li>Console Units: Console units control your tardis. Place them in your tardis, and right click on them to use them.  Most consle units should be pretty self-explainatory in you understand X/Y/Z coordinates.</li>
<li>Time Rotor: Used to power the tardis. It will slowly generate power that is used for all tardis operations. Having multiple time rotors in your tardis will not generate power faster.</li>
<li>Sonic Screwdriver: Can be created from a button on the fuctions consle unit.  It can summon your tardis (for 3 energy), lock your tardis, and let open locked doors</li>
<li>Tardis Screen: Displays tardis status</li>
</ul>
