# Taridis_New
Adds a functioning Tardis to the game minetest
	
## Features:

- Gallifreyan Lab: Used to create arton crytals (from mese) and compressed space time (from diamond blocks).  It does not require fuel, but is notably bad for your health!
- Tardises: Simply craft a tardis, place it on the ground, and walk through the door.  You'll have to craft seperate console units to control and fly your tardis.
- Console Units: Console units control your tardis. Place them in your tardis, and right click on them to use them.  Most consle units should be pretty self-explainatory in you - understand X/Y/Z coordinates.
- Time Rotor: Used to power the tardis. It will slowly generate power that is used for all tardis operations. Having multiple time rotors in your tardis will not generate power -faster. Right click on it to see how much power your Tardis has.
- Moniter: Displays your current position, destination, power, ect.
- Sonic Screwdriver: Can be created from a button on the fuctions consle unit.
- Vortex Manipulator: Easy time travel (also notatbly bad for your health)
- Gaunlet of Rasilion: A powerful weapon.
- Dalekanium Tools: Better than diamond, made from azbantium, gold, steel, and obsidian.
- Galifreyan Chests: Very large, very expensive. 
- chat command (/summon_tardis) can be used to summon your Tarids (if you have the bring privlage).
